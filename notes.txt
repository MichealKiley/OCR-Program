Have the picture go through the initial two filters, 
the results are then split into 2 piles sorted by a character limiter (EX: if len(x) > 10)

Pile 1 = pictures with good results
    - checked against SKU db to see matches

Pile 2 = pictures with bad results
    - rescanned using RGB filters, then sorted into 2 piles once again.
